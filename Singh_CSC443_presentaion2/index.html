                            My first impression of accessing WWW was very informative. As the technology started advancing, more people stated getting access to the internet. 
                            I actually had no idea how the internet use to work back in the days. I just used to play online miniclip games online. As the World wide web advcaned,
                            I started accessing it more often then ususal. But I was just amazed how the website use to behave. I know  web applications are very advanced now but 
                            at that time it was amazing to browse around get the content you wanted.

                            My computer relation to the public internet was very basic at that time. I used to have sony viao laptop with extrnal speakers. I use to have 
                            internet mondem which was connected to the public internet through a landline Dial up phone. I could either connect to it through wifi or WLAN
                             cable. I harldy use to get over 1mb/s download speed. Public internet was very slow at that time.

                            My computer relation to the public internet now is very different from how it was before. Now I have a Dell's laptop, Macbook air and a 
                            lenovo thinkpad which are all connected to the public internet pretty much 24/7. Along with that I have few components connected to my computer 
                            like wireless mouse, monitors, keyboard and a printer. Which all play an important part on interating with the internet daily to complete 
                            certain tasks. Now I have over 300 mb/s internet speed.

                            I have been studying computer science from the past 2 years at southern connecticut state univeristy. Learned python, SQL and java. In terms of web development I've learned
                            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Worked on couple of projects which was making a message chatting website for one of classes
                             using HTML, CSS , javascript, SQL and web sockets. Also worked on developing a Phishing website detection python program for data mining class.

                            Right now I'm a senior Majoring in Computer science- General at SCSU. I'm taking 4 CS elective classes right now which are: <br>
                            CSC-443 Internet programming----CSC-400 Capstone <br>
                            CSC-431 Computer Graphics----CSC-421 Theory of Parllel Programming

                            My plan going forward will to either go for My master's degree program or for a Computer science related job. 
                             Not sure what particular role I want to go to but a role in Technical Engineering or Software dev would definetly be my first pick

                        For this presentation I chose to go with a dark blue background for all my slides. I'm using 2 background images. One has a light white light 
                        in the middle and the other one is dark blue. Im using the light background to display diagrams and dark to display my text boxes. I'm using 
                        light grey text box for responses beacuse it looks very decent and very easy for the user to read context. That's preety much the whole style im using 
                        for my presentation.

                                For this presentaion I'm using webslide.js open source framework. which in my opinion works best for web presentations.
                                I've been playing around with it and I have learned alot on how to use specific class, divs, types and how you can override some of 
                                components. I aim to learn more about this framework in upcoming presentations.

                                Another way you can host your website is by using google clould, which in my opinion is fairly cheap and easy to manage.

                                <h3 ><p style="color:white;">  Can you suggest any other way of making the content and style, if not the behavior 
                                    of your web presentation accessible without the public Internet? </p></h3>

                                    I'll say yes, if I send other users all my file content, they will be able to see the behavior and content of my webpage. but 
                                    without any type of file sharing and no internet, I don't think so. May you I host it on my machine, But I would still need some connection to other 
                                    user to have them access my web presentation.
